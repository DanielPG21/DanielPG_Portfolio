        The artwork is named Empty Reflections which consists of two photographs.
        The photographs are reflections of myself holding a mirror.
        My intention for this artwork is to explore the perception of oneself.
        We can perceive others easily but have difficulty in seeing within ourselves.
        Some can also get caught up in the molding of outside influences which would lead them to burry a sense of themselves to gain a false persona.
        I try to reverse this notion by covering my face, leaving the audience unable to perceive who I am.
        The mirror would serve as a metaphorical reflection of the audience.
        My approach for this project is by using two mirrors, one will portray the subject within its reflection which in this case will be me and camera.
        The second camera will be held by me and will basically be empty of subject matter in its reflection.
        After the production process I edited the photographs in Adobe Lightroom, where the photographs were turned to black and white and had their levels adjusted.
        It was then edited in Adobe Photoshop to make alterations.

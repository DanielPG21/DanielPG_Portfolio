    <h2>"Empty Reflections", 2021, 1200 x 800, Photography</h2>
    <!-- <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">Adobe Lightroom Classic and Photoshop</h2> -->
    <p class="a">
        "Empty Reflections" consists of two photographs.
        The photographs are literal reflections of myself holding a mirror.
        My intention for this artwork is to explore the perception of oneself.
        I believe that we can perceive others easily but will have difficulty in seeing within ourselves.
        Some can also get caught up in the molding of outside influences which would lead them to burry a sense of themselves to gain a false persona.
        I try to mirror this notion by covering my face, leaving it unable for the audience and myself to perceive who I am.
        My approach for this project is by using two mirrors, one will portray the subject within its reflection which in this case will be me and the camera.
        The second mirror will be held by me and will basically be empty of subject matter in its reflection.
        After the production process I edited the photographs in Adobe Lightroom Classic, where the photographs were turned to black and white and had their levels adjusted.
        It was then edited in Adobe Photoshop to make alterations, such as making the sofa symmetrical.

    <p class="a">
        Missing Person's Found Footage is my attempt in covering the genre of horror by using the technique of found footage.
        I wanted to branch out from traditional methods of conveying horror such as jump scares, and music.
        In this artwork I wanted to use the method of analog horror in where the story is more obscure.
        This artwork was created with footage filmed by me, the audio is a heavily edited sound effect from the video game Subnautica.
        Programs used for this piece is Runway, After Effects, Audacity, and Audition.

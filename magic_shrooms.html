    <p class="a">
        "Dan’s Magic Shrooms" is a video based on the comedic and idiotic premise of my character selling mushrooms. 
        This video is a clear parody of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” 
        As a big fan of the show I wanted to make my own parody of the series.
        Though not as professional nor good as the original product, I attempted to reach the same outcome of making people laugh.
        This was achieved by writing a competent script, overseeing the production, and editing the video to elevate its comedic premise.
        This was made with Adobe After Effects.

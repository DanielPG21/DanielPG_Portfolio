        This is an original scripted video.
        We see the challenges that go through scripting, filming, and editing.
        This was inspired by “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” which can be seen with the structure, opening credits, and final scene of the video.
        The production showed me how difficult it is to write a competent script, not that this is a good script.
        The production process also shows the difficulty of acting and directing.
        Even though I had all these challenges and the final product was somewhat embarrassing, I was still happy with the end results.
        This was edited in Adobe After Effects.

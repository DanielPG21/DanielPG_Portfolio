        "Tanks" is artwork created with 3D models.
        This art piece consists of two artworks with the same object in two different scenarios.
        The first picture shows two tanks in the desert while the second picture shows a tank on a floor with a pencil.
        This shows how context can change our perception of events, people, and objects.
        The first picture insinuates two tanks taking part in some kind of warfare activity.
        The second picture shows the same tank but in a different scenery.
        This time the tank can be interpreted as a toy since it is seen next to a pencil.
        The models featured in the artwork was created and textured in Maya.

        “My Room” is a loose interpretation of my real life room.
        The 3D model was created in Blender and painted in Sketchfab.
        This artwork gives audiences a sense of what my interests are with the variety of objects that can be found.
        One can observe how I like to read with the stacks of books atop of the dresser.
        There is also a game console and computer to show that I also like to watch videos and play video games.
        With the variety of objects, the audience can piece together an idea of the person living within it.
        The artwork also shows my comedic side with the use of random and funny imagery found on the posters and bed sheet.

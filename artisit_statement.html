    <h1>ARTIST STATEMENT</h1>

    <p class="a">
        Art is the creative medium an artist uses to communicate with the audience.
        The use of art allows the person to express all aspects of life, be it pleasant or tragic, into the truest form of aesthetic beauty.
        As an artist who has a deep interest in the digital aspect of art, I have studied its respective mediums with great determination.
        From my teenage years I have learned to create 2D artworks in applications like Adobe Photoshop and Clip Studio.
        This then evolved into studying more complex mediums such as 3D art with the use of Maya and Blender.
        Though, my greatest specialty is in the medium of cinematography and the use of the software revolving around the craft.
        For the creation of videos I have used Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Audition, and even Photoshop.
        With these tools I have created works that explored different manners of communicating a story.
        From making the audience laugh with comedic sketches to sharing knowledge with documentary works. 
        <br>My greatest objective in art is to create a number of sophisticated stories that explore the many aspects of humanity and life.
        With comprehensive knowledge in the principles of storytelling and the technical understanding of the relative crafts, I am certain that I can achieve this dream.
        It is not only my goal to communicate my thoughts and experiences through my works, but to lead others to critically analyze the world around them.
        And, hopefully inspire other artists to pursue their passions and make their own contributions to humanity.
        For this reason, I would like to continue my studies at San Jose State University.
        Even with my deep knowledge in digital art, there is still more I can learn from studying in the Digital Media Arts program.
        This opportunity would allow me to expand my methods of storytelling by my continued learning.
        <br>My determination can hopefully be observed with the selection of artworks presented in my portfolio.
        Admittedly, web coding is my least impressive skill set. With this fact, I have chosen to create a portfolio with a simple design.
        This decision was also made to emphasize the quality of the artworks presented within the portfolio.
        The artworks consist of digital art, coding art, and cinematography art.
        The theme that surrounds these artworks is the emphasizing of who I am.
        All the artworks present a part of myself and communicate to the audience aspects of my character.
        For example, the two video artworks show two completely different aspects of how I tell a story.
        With one of the videos, I show that I am a comedic person while another video shows my ability to intelligently explain subjects I am passionate about.
        Both my artworks that involve coding reveal my love of music and share a variety of genres for others to enjoy.
        This revelation of oneself is quite liberating for me, because in the wake of a pandemic I am unable to have a social life as I once had.
        So, even though I might not be able to socialize in person, my artwork can serve as a representation of myself and show people the person I am.
        <br>With my long history of learning art I have understood and utilized a variety of mediums.
        I have always tried my best when creating these artworks, from creating 2D artworks in Photoshop to undertaking complex projects revolving cinematography.
        Despite knowing a lot about digital art, I find it necessary to further my learning career by attending the DMA program in SJSU.
        With what I learn, I will be able to create even greater artworks that can express my ideas and emotions to a broader audience.
        Let this portfolio be the proof of my unwavering determination to achieve my goal.

    <h1>ARTIST STATEMENT</h1>

    <p class="a">
        Art is the creative medium an artist uses to communicate with their audience.
        The use of art allows the person to express all aspects of life, be it pleasant or tragic, into the truest form of aesthetic beauty.
        Artists are able to convey these themes and ideas through a plethora of mediums.
        In relation to myself, I convey the ideas of humanity and life through the use of storytelling.
        Though, I do not intend to limit myself to the use of conventional methods of storytelling and would push the limitations in how a story could be told.
        As an artist, I would like to experiment in different mediums, such as video games, video, graphic novels, and other means.
        With comprehensive knowledge in the principles of storytelling and the technical understanding of the relative crafts, I am certain that I can achieve this dream.
        It is not only my goal to communicate my thoughts and experiences through my works, but to lead others to critically analyze the world around them.
        And, hopefully inspire other artists to pursue their passions and make their own contributions to society.

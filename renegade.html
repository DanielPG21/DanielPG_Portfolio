        Renegade, is a 3D animated short film that explores the journey of a lone warrior finding their own purpose in a hellscape world.
        Originally called in service of a higher authority, the vagabond traverses the remains of a dying civilization filled with relentless and ruthless foes.
        During their struggle for survival the vagabond also experiences flashes of their past life. The lone warrior is left to cut their own path.
        This animated short film is inspired by the Dark Souls series, in an attempt to recreate the effective environmental storytelling that allows clear communication of ideas.
        This project is the culmination of my personal experiences, understanding, and knowledge of the arts.
        Renegade is a proud milestone in my journey of creating art, challenging perspectives, and expressing ideas.

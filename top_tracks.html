        This project consists of photographs of myself holding a mirror. 
        My intention for this project is to explore the perception of oneself. 
        We can perceive others easily but have difficulty in reflecting on our ourselves. 
        We can also get caught up in the molding of outside influences, gaining an alter persona while burrying a sense of our selves. 
        My approach for this project is by using two mirrors, one will reflect the subject while the other mirror will be held by me. 
        The photographs were also edited in Photoshop and Lightroom.
        The 'Spot Healing' and 'Healing' brush were used in Photoshop to mask unwanted areas. 
        The photograph was converted to Black and White in Lightroom.

        For this project I wanted to use music as the defining feature, and to convey this I decided to create a computer window.
        This was done because I mostly listen to music on my devices such as my phone and computer.
        To me, music is a part of ourselves and a reflection to our personalities and thoughts.
        The data I retrieved to make this avatar came from my “Top tracks this month” feature in Spotify.
        I recorded this data manually via a spreadsheet.
        With this information I made my playlist and visually represented what genres I listen to.
        The bottom window contains 12 interactive buttons which, when clicked, will play a song.
        Each song comes from different genres and artists to show the diversity of my playlist.
        As you go through the songs, you can observe the rank of the songs going higher.
        You can also see how many songs are within that genre.
        The top right window contains a mouth, represented by an ellipse, which will move when a song is played.
        The left window contains an eye and will change color when the canvas is clicked.

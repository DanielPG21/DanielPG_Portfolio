    <h2>Top Tracks This Month | 2021 | Coding<br>p5js and Adobe Audition</h2>
    <h3>(Set volume to appropiate levels before interacting)</h3>

    <p class="c">
        For this artistic piece, I wanted to focus on the music I listen to on a regular basis.
        The data used for this project was retrieved from the “Top tracks this month” feature in Spotify, which consists of 50 songs.
        The artwork consists of three fake browser windows, with the bottom window containing 12 interactive buttons. 
        When a button is clicked, a snippet of a song will play with information relating to it being displayed on the left hand side.
        The information consists of the song’s name, its genre, the number of songs within that genre, and the rank that song is in the Spotify playlist.
        Below the buttons is a visual representation of the playlist with the width of the series of rectangles being in proportion to the number of songs within a genre. 
        Each genre is also regulated to a color for easier identification.
        With "Top Tracks This Month", I can turn mundane data into a fascinating work of self expression. 
        This allows me to share my taste of music while allowing the audience to gain an understanding of who I am.
        This artwork is made with p5js and Adobe Audition.

        A Humanist Tale was created to introduce audiences to one of my favorite video games, Nier Automata.
        The video begins with a short narrative explaining the circumstances of what led me to cover this subject. 
        When covering this video game I focused on the components that made Nier Automata an artistic masterpiece.
        I was deeply moved by the game’s use of philosophical themes within a tragic tale.
        These components greatly elevated the game’s ultimate question, “what does it mean to be human?”
        That is why I chose to cover this game to my audience.
        To spread the knowledge of this masterpiece and hopefully give them a reason to experience its contents.<br>
        This video was made from a collection of footage and music.
        This was to show the points I wanted to adress.
        It also allowed me to enhance the message I wanted to convey by weaving my narritive with the footage.
        Some of the footage was filmed by me with the rest originating from other sources.
        With carefull consideration of the legality and ethics of using other people works, I carefully edited the video so it can fall under Fair Use.
        This was made with Adobe Premiere and Audition.

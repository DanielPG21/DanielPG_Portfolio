        This video was created to explore one of my favorite video games, Nier Automata.
        I started off with introducing the subject of the video, then exploring the gameplay, music, and themes of the game.
        I introduce the audience to the creator of the game Yoko Taro and how he uses his writing to deliver an emotional and thought provoking work.
        We see the human philosophies that are explored in the game and how it relates to the story and characters.
        When I played Nier Automata, I was deeply moved and it made me reflect on what it means to be human.
        The game has greatly succeeded in its objective and I wanted others to play the game and experience it through their lenses.
        This video was made from a collection of videos and music.
        Even though some footage and audio does not originate from me, I believe this final product would qualify under Fair Use.
        This was made via Adobe Premiere and Audition.

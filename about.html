      Hello Hola Bonjour こんにちは<br>
      Daniel Perez Gomez ダニエル・ゴメズ<br>
    </p>

    <p class="b">
      Hello, my name is Daniel Perez Gomez, an artist at San Jose State University. I was born in this very state within the city of Santa Clara and lived most of my life in Modesto. 
      Throughout my time I had a keen interest in the arts, from my early childhood I was infatuated with cartoons and other animated works. 
      This started my track to become an artist, to create something that can play a role in the lives of others, just how it affected me. 
      Growing up with the advancements of technology, a plethora of artists has risen and new methods were discovered, expanding the limits of what art can be. 
      Inspired by a variety of artists, Yoko Taro is one of these artists, a man who uses New Media Arts to tell intriguing stories and discusses philosophical subjects in video games. 
      There is Banksy, someone who uses graffiti to express his views. Thanks to these artistic influences and others, I have expanded my view on what art can be and I want to expand the limits of what art is. 
      Like stated earlier I want to reach the hearts of my audience and leave an impression of my works so it can bring some influence into their lives.

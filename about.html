    Hello Hola Bonjour こんにちは<br>
    Daniel Perez Gomez ダニエル・ゴメズ<br>
  </p>

  <p class="b">
    Hello, my name is Daniel Perez Gomez, an artist from Modesto and a current student at San Jose State University.
    Just like many of my colleagues, I am the child of migrants who arrived in the United States from their home country of Mexico. 
    Despite the hardships one would face under such circumstances, I was lucky enough to explore a variety of interests.
    I am curious by nature and always used every opportunity to learn something new.
    When it comes to art I wanted to express my creativeness and used different mediums to reach my artistic goals.  
    What ultimately led me to choose art as a professional career is having the ability to influence others with one’s artworks.
    Artists have the ability to communicate with the broader world and hopefully inspire others to follow their own paths.

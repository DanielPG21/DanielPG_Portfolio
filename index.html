    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p class="a">
        Daniel Perez Gomez is an artist originating from Modesto and a student at San Jose State University.
        A child of Mexican immigrants, the possibility in becoming something greater than what society deemed him was quite slim.
        Despite the hardships of poverty, faith, and tradition, the yearning to follow the path of art has stayed resolute. The artistâ€™s curious nature has led him to use every opportunity to learn something new and explore different mediums. With the education provided in SJSU, and an ever-growing catalog of artworks, Daniel is determined to create artworks that can create a deep impression to the people that view them and inspire others to follow their own artistic goals.
        <br>Daniel Perez Gomez is experienced with many Adobe applications such as Adobe Audition, After Effects, Illustrator, Lightroom Classic, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro. Other applications include Blender and Maya. In terms of coding, the artist is knowledgeable in HTML, CSS, three.js, and p5.js.
        After Effects, Illustrator, Lightroom Classic, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Substance Painter. I am also experienced with Blender, Maya, p5.js and HTML.

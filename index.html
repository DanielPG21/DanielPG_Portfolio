    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p class="c">
        Hello, my name is Daniel Perez Gomez, an artist from Modesto and a student at San Jose State University.
        I am the child of migrants who arrived from Mexico. 
        Despite the hardships one would face under such circumstances, I was fortunate enough to further my interest in art
        My curious nature has led me to use every opportunity to learn something new.
        With this mindset I explored many mediums in art to create a variety of artworks, from traditional to digital artworks.
        What I love about art is the ability to use oneâ€™s creativeness to communicate with others.
        This ultimately led me to choose Digital Media Art as my professional career.
        That is why my main goal in studying at San Jose State University is to be able to create artworks that focus in cinematography and 3D animation.
        With this knowledge I would like to create a variety of content that can be admired by a large audience.
        I would like to explore all the genres that are present in storytelling, from creating comedies to documentaries.
        Hopefully my artworks will cause a deep impression to the people that view them and inspire some to follow their own artistic goals. 
        <br>I am experienced with many of the Adobe products such as Adobe Audition, After Effects, Illustrator, Lightroom Classic, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro. I am also experienced with Blender, Maya, p5.js and HTML.

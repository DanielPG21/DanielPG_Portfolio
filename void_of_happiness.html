    <h2>In Void Of Happiness | 2021 | Digital Art<br>Adobe Photoshop</h2>

    <p class="c">
        This art piece is a crudely drawn image consisting of black and white shades.
        The concept of this art piece consists of a figure known as a “wagie wojak”, a meme representation of those employed at low-level, undesirable positions.
        He is inside a gas station looking out of the window with an emotionless expression.
        The gas station and its immediate vicinity will have the lightest tones to represent the light emanating from the building.
        Symbolically, it represents the person's only means of being able to survive through a capitalist system.
        The surrounding area consists of a black void to symbolize the night and the lack of hope and joy he experiences.
        The artwork was made in Adobe Photoshop.

        Continuing with the theme of music, I made a randomizer playlist for this project.
        The playlist is composed of 30 songs from various genres.
        With a large selection of music, the odds of the user hearing a new song is quite high.
        This was done because I want to give people the opportunity to expand their catalog of music and experience something new.
        The randomizer consists of two buttons, where the “Music Box” button will randomly choose a song.
        It will also show a set of photos from the Voyager’s Golden Record.
        Clicking the button will also play a 2 second audio clip of Daft Punk's "Robot Rock" song.
        The “Playlist” button will lead to a YouTube playlist with the featured songs.
        This artwork was made with p5js and Adobe Audition.

    <h2>Simple Chaos | 2017 | Digital Art<br>Adobe Photoshop</h2>

    <p class="c">
        The artwork is an attempt to create abstract art in the truest sense.
        The name originates from the chaotic features that form the overall artwork.
        This can be observed with the cyan waves that form at the outer boundaries of the artwork, containing a spiral of the opposite color.
        The outer edge of the spiral are columns of rectangles based on the primary colors.
        There is no clear interpretation of this artwork, as it is common for any abstract artwork.
        I wanted audiences to reach their conclusion on what “Simple Chaos” could represent.
        The artwork was created with Photoshop.
        The process consists of making blotches and shapes of select colors, I then used the many tools that can be found under the filter tab to achieve the final product.

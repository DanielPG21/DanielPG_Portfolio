        The similarities of these photos is the use of split toning.
        The first photo consisting of a parakeet was done via Adobe Photoshop.
        This was done by turning the image to black and white.
        After that I selected different colors for the shadows and highlights which led to the results seen on these images.
        I also made other minor adjustments.
        The second photo consists of three amiibos which was split toned on Adobe Lightroom.
        This also included the same process but in Adobe Lightroom.

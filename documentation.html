    <h1>DOCUMENTATION</h1>

    <p class="a">
        For the exhbition "Press Play," I've created a five minuite 3D animated short film titled <i>Renegade</i>.
        All the assets used in the animated short was created through Blender, a 3D computer graphics software.
        The Blender add-on "Drips Psx Efx" was used to apply Playstation 1 effects on the assets.
        This includes screen space vertex snapping, affine texture mapping, dithering, and other effects.
        The animations were created through Wonder Dynamics, an AI motion capture tool.
        Through Wonder Dynamics, footage of myself and my assisntant were motion captured and applied to the character assets.
        Editing of the footage was done through Adobe After Effects.
        The physical components of the artowrk consisted of a JVC 20" CRT TV, TV model TV-20F243, displayed on a pedestal.
        The footage was played through a "Micca Speck G2 Ultra-Portable Media Player" and coverted to VA via a "Sorthol MINI HDMI to RCA Converter."

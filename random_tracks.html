        As some might know I love music, for this reason, I made a playlist for this project.
        I made a playlist composed of 30 songs from various genres.
        The playlist is quite diverse because I have no knowledge of what music someone has heard.
        With a large selection, the odds of the user experiencing a new song is higher.
        I want people to expand their catalogue of music and experience something new.
        I believe that having a broad catalogue of anything can lead to a greater understanding and outlook.
        The  randomizer consists of two buttons, where the “Music Box” button will randomly choose a song.
        It will also show a set of photos from the Voyager’s Golden Record.
        I believe it's quite fitting for whomever encounters the record will also experience something new as well.
        Clicking the button will also play a 2 second audio clip of Daft Punk's "Robot Rock" song.
        The “Playlist” button will lead to a YouTube playlist with the featured songs.
